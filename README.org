* Backups with the Borg system
These scripts are heavily customized for my user ID and paths. I use a
scheduler to execute the borg.sh script for my backups.

The borg.sh script starts up the Box.com daemon on my Mac which is the
destination for my backups. It executes borg and saves a list of files
backed up, and stops the Box.com daemon after a time.

I keep most tweakable variables in the env.sh script.
